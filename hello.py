print('Version control systems are tools that teams use to change code over time. They track and manage changes to files over time. \
Version control systems help teams work faster with them, then without them. As well as, allowing multiple developers, designers, \
and team members to work on the same project. VCS makes insure that all team members have access to the latest codes, and \
tracks the modifications that are made. To see the current directory that you are working in you must type pwd (print work directory).\
You can change dirctories by pressing the cd command. For example, typing cd pictures will bring you to your pictures folder.\
In closing Version Control Systems are a powerful tool that helps teams (developers, designers, etc.). VCS code improves\
visibility, helps teams collaborate around the world, and accelerates product delivery. Teams are better because of it.')
